          <h2>Who I Am</h2>
          <p>
            My start with programming began when I was 8 years old, interested
            in knowing how programs and computers worked, I started learning the
            basic principles of programming with didactic games for children,
            these games taught javascript, and although they were 'children's
            games', I was able to learn things like, what is a boolean?, what is
            an if statement?, what is a while statement?, etc. Then over the
            years I dedicated myself to working with computers from the hardware
            side but I ended up realizing that what I liked the most was
            programming.

            I formed my education in the Zero To Mastery academy and I was
            learning skills on my own, I consider myself a self-taught person
            with a great capacity to obtain knowledge and put it into practice,
            I can also adapt very well to different work environments and I am
            always willing to learn technologies new ones that help make my
            creations more efficient. Today I am working with Next.Js,
            typescript and some tools that you can see below.
