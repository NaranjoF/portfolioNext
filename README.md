# Web portfolio mainly using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Redux, Jest, Cypress

This is my personal portfolio, it was created in NEXT.JS, using TYPESCRIPT as a programming language, REDUX to handle states, TAILWIND to style the project, JEST to perform unit tests and CYPRESS to perform E2E tests. Also use other tools like react hook forms, next-redux-wrapper, sendgrid, i18n, among others.
