# Web portfolio mainly using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Redux, Jest, Cypress

This is my personal portfolio, it was created in NEXT.JS, using TYPESCRIPT as a programming language, REDUX to handle states, TAILWIND to style the project, JEST to perform unit tests and CYPRESS to perform E2E tests. Also use other tools like react hook forms, next-redux-wrapper, sendgrid, i18n, among others.

-This Project has:

- HOMEPAGE: Here we have a homepage with a welcome message telling a little about me and with some links to contact me. We also have a navbar, with some shortcuts to go to the different sections of this website, in addition to a 'DL CV' button, that when we click on it you can download my curriculum vitae. Right next to it we can select in which language we want to see the web page (English or Spanish)
